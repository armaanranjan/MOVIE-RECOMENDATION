# MOVIE RECOMENDATION SYSTEM
## ABOUT THE PROJECT
* it is built with a dataset from kaggle named movie lens small dataset. In this project we use 3 csv files to get the ratings of each movie the users that have watched it. We will be using the KNN algorithm to compute similarity with cosine distance metric and making recomendations of the movies to be watched next if they have seen a movie previously.
